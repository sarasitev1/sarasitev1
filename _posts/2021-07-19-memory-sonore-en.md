This game is a sonic adaptation of the famous memory game, which is usually known with images.  Each cube is playing a sound when it is upside-down. One sound is present in 2 different cubes, and the aim of the game is to find identical pairs.
  
The sounds in the cube were recorded during a sound workshop with children from a school in Arles. In the same way, the game has been built collectively.
