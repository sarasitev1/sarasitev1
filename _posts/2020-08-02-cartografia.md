Cartography of Memories is a collaborative sound map that seeks to record and preserve, through oral reports, experiences in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which began in 2020. We want to achieve the greatest number and diversity of reports possible, and thus configure a heterogeneous panorama, which values listening to subjectivities about this worldwide event.

The reports are recorded in audio, with a maximum duration of 5 minutes. Identities are preserved, only the location is required for the report to be properly added to the map. The form and theme are free, spontaneity is therefore valued: the world is experiencing a pandemic, and how do you feel?

The project was created in Brazil by a group of historians, scientists, artists, communicators, developers, educators and disseminators. These professionals met through the Emergency Laboratory | Covid – 19 to work together on solidarity alternatives, especially relevant in the Brazilian context.

This project is supported by a grant from the Open Society Foundations, managed by the Center for Applied Human Rights - York University (United Kingdom) | Art + Activism Against Repression During the Covid-19 Crisis.
