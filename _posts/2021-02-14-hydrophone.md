## step 1: plastic lid preparation 

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
     <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone2.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
      <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone4.jpg" class="img-border">
      <br>
   </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone3.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone5.jpg" class="img-border">
    </div>
</div>
<br>

* Choose a plastic lid with a diameter about 1cm bigger than piezoeletric’s diameter. In our video we used a 1″ piezo (25mm)
  
* With a ruler mark the center of the plastic piece
  
* Make a hole with the drilling machine and the hole saw.
(The hole saw diameter should be a bit smaller than piezoelectric diameter)
  
* On the side of the plastic lid make a hole with the drill. It’s where the mic cable will pass through.

## step 2: copper foil 

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
     <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone6.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
      <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone9.jpg" class="img-border">
      <br>
   </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone7.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone10.jpg" class="img-border">
    </div>
</div>
<br>

We will use the copper to protect the hydrophone from electro-magnetic interference.
  
* Measure the plastic lid height
  
* Cut the copper foil as a strip with the same height.
  
* Take the copper strip and internally cover the lid.
  
* Fix the copper ring with electrical tape
  
* With scissors cut a hole on the side of the ring
Note: it exist a self-adhesive copper foil which could be better for this use (and easier to work with)

## step 3: piezo and cable soldering

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
     <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone11.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
      <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone13.jpg" class="img-border">
      <br>
   </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone12.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone14.jpg" class="img-border">
    </div>
</div>
<br>

* Position the piezo centered outside of the lid. The terminals must be seen inside the hole.
  
* Fix it with electric tape. It will be removed on step 5.
  
* Before soldering put 2″of thermofit on both sides of the cable.
  
* Pass the mic cable through the lid and copper holes and solder it on piezo’s terminals : ground on the external part, positive on the internal part of the piezo.
  
* Solder the 1/4″mono jack plug  on the other side of the cable.
  
* After soldering, reposition the thermofit and get it hot with the lighter.<br>
**Note:** it would be possible to use a stereo cable to have probably better shielding. You should then connect ground to the copper foil, positive on the center and negative on the external part of the piezo.

## step 4: silicon and iron washers

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
     <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone15.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
      <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone18.jpg" class="img-border">
      <br>
   </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone16.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone19.jpg" class="img-border">
    </div>
</div>
<br>

* Fill half of the lid with silicon.
  
* Put 2 iron washers inside it. (In order to give some weight to the hydrophone)
  
* Fill the rest of the lid with silicon.
  
* Cut a copper foil circle, with the same diameter as the lid.
  
*  Put the copper circle on the top of the silicon, so it will get glued._ Wait until the silicon dries (about 30 minutes)<br>
**Note:** you could put some weight on top of the copper foil, so it will get straighter.

## step 5: rubber coating

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
     <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone21.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
      <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone25.jpg" class="img-border">
      <br>
   </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone23.jpg" class="img-border">
        <br> <br>
        <img src="../assets/posts/hydrophone26.jpg" class="img-border">
    </div>
</div>
<br>


* Carefully remove the electric tape from the piezo.
  
* Dip the lid in the rubber coating can and take it out very slowly.
  
* Let it dry for around 30 minutes and repeat this step 2 or 3 times.
  
* For a uniform rubber layer, you can turn the lid upside down while drying

## step 6: Listening
  
* Try your hydrophone and share your recording
  
* Enjoy !!

Other nice hydrophone tutorials where we learned to construct ours:

*  [Phase 57](http://www.phase57.com/build/contact-mic){:target="_blank"} give a very similar way of building a contact microphone, shield as ours, and I guess that could easily be used as a hydrophone<br>

* [Zach Poff](https://www.zachpoff.com/resources/building-contact-mics){:target="_blank"} give a step by step building of a contact mic in a very easy way. With an interesting list of other places to buy some contact mic online (at the bottom of the page)<br>

* [Monkey Sound](https://www.etsy.com/fr/shop/MonkeySound){:target="_blank"} is doing and selling a few nice models too
  
* [Geophone by LOM Audio](https://store.lom.audio/products/geofon){:target="_blank"}. It is not an hydrophone, but it’s a very nice tool for contact recording 

* [Ambient](https://ambient.de/en/product_custom_cat/underwater-en/){:target="_blank"} sells ones of the best hydrophones, but with a much higher price
