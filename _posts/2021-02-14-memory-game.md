We’re using cube which are playing a sound when they’re upside-down, hidden in itself. One sound is inside 2 different cubes, and the aim of the game is to find identical pairs.

<div class="video-wrapper-side video-wrapper-16x9"><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/512180495?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<br><br>

The sounds used in the cube are recorded during a sound recording workshop with children. In the same way, the game is built collectively, during an electronico workshop. 
<br>
The quantity and dimension of the cube is defined during the process. 
The cubes are placed on a wireless power base.

      <b>STEP 1 | Recording</b><br><br>
Participants learn the basic use of hand recorders, microphones and headphones. A few exercises familiarize them with the equipment and the listening of the sounds from their environment. We select together the sounds that will be part of the game, a sketch of their daily soundscape.
