Pack is a canine radio recorded and transmitted by mutts. 
Radio-transmitting dog collars were created, via FM-UHF, which were able to transmit the surrounding sounds of the dogs which wore them. 
  
Based on a mobile FM_receptor it was possible to sintonize each of the dogs and to listen to them in real time, jumping from one dog to another, combining their sounds and aurally drawing a choreography of the packs of the region. 
  
Thus proportioning a spatialized listening based on the aural perspectives of the mutts in the neighborhood.
