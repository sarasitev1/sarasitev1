## SERTÃO SOUND DIARY
**Mônica Meyer e Sara Lana**
<br><br><br>
The **Sertão Sound Diary** is a documentary record based on the path and notes of Guimarães Rosa on his trip to the hinterland of Minas Gerais in 1952.
<br><br>
A Boiada (The Herd), title given by the writer to his diary, leaves Fazenda da Sirga (Andrequicé) in the direction of Fazenda São Francisco (Araçaí).
<br><br>
The most diverse sounds leap from the pages and stimulate a synesthesically sharp sense of the senses, listening to the symphony of the cerrado.
